- Dark modern UI with gradient effects and smooth animations
- Mobile responsive with hamburger menu
- Navigation to /analyze route
- Dev server running on localhost:3000

### What is pending
- [x] Phase 3: Build analyzer page UI (resume input, JD input, results panel)
- [x] Phase 4: Implement analysis logic (keyword matching, scoring)
- [ ] Phase 5: AI features (resume suggestions, outreach generation)
- [ ] Phase 6: Supabase integration (save sessions, optional auth)

---

## Phase 2: Landing Page ✅
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### What was built
- **Navbar:** Fixed top bar with logo, nav links, CTA button, animated mobile menu
- **Hero:** Full-height section with gradient background blurs, badge, headline with gradient text, dual CTA buttons, social proof line
- **Features:** 6-card grid with icons — Match Score, Missing Keywords, Weak Sections, Rejection Risk, AI Suggestions, Outreach Helper
- **How It Works:** 3-step visual flow with icons and connector lines
- **CTA:** Gradient card with glow effect and action button
- **Footer:** Minimal with logo and GitHub link

### Design
- Premium dark UI with purple accent palette

---

## Phase 3 & 4: Analyzer Page UI + Analysis Logic ✅
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### What was built
- **Analyzer Page** (`/analyze`) — full interactive resume analysis tool
- **AnalyzerForm** — two-panel layout: resume + JD inputs (left), results (right)
- **ResultsPanel** — displays all analysis results with animated sections
- **ScoreRing** — animated SVG circular progress indicator for match score
- **Analysis Engine** (`lib/analyzer.ts`) — keyword extraction, scoring, weak section detection, rejection risk calculation

### New UI components
- `Textarea` — styled textarea with focus ring and dark theme
- `Badge` — multi-variant badge (default, success, warning, destructive, outline)
- `Progress` — animated progress bar with custom indicator color

### Analysis engine features
- **Keyword extraction** across 7 categories: programming, frameworks, cloud, data, databases, soft skills, general
- **Match scoring** — ratio of matched keywords + structure bonus
- **Weak section detection** — checks for education, experience, skills, projects, quantified achievements, action verbs
- **Rejection risk** — composite score from missing keyword ratio + critical weak sections
- **Improvement suggestions** — auto-generated based on gaps found

### Updated folder structure

    └── analyzer.ts                 # Core analysis engine (keyword matching, scoring)
```

### Key decisions
- **Client-side analysis** for Phase 4 — instant results, no API needed, zero latency
- **Animated score ring** with color coding (green/amber/red) for immediate visual feedback
- **Staggered card animations** in results for polished feel
- **Input validation** with error messages (min length checks)
- **Loading state** with 1.2s simulated delay for better UX perception

### What is working
- Full end-to-end flow: paste resume + JD → analyze → see results
- Match score with animated ring
- Keyword analysis (found vs missing)
- Rejection risk with progress bar and reasons
- Weak section detection with severity badges
- AI improvement suggestions
- Reset functionality
- Responsive layout (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)

### What is pending
- [x] Phase 5: AI features (LLM-powered resume rewriting, outreach messages)
- [ ] Phase 6: Supabase integration (save sessions, optional auth)

---

## Phase 5: AI Features (Groq + Llama 3) ✅
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### What was built
- **Groq API integration** using `groq-sdk` with Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model
- **AI Suggestions API** (`/api/ai/suggestions`) — generates 5 personalized resume improvement suggestions
- **Outreach Generator API** (`/api/ai/outreach`) — generates LinkedIn connection request + recruiter email
- **AISuggestions component** — expandable accordion with copy-to-clipboard, loading states, error handling, regenerate
- **OutreachGenerator component** — LinkedIn + Email message cards with copy buttons

### Tech used
- Groq SDK (Llama 3.3 70B Versatile)
- Next.js API Routes (App Router)
- Server-side API key handling (never exposed to client)

### API routes
- `POST /api/ai/suggestions` — accepts resume, JD, missing keywords, weak sections → returns 5 AI suggestions
- `POST /api/ai/outreach` — accepts resume, JD, match score → returns LinkedIn + email messages

### Key decisions
- **Groq over OpenAI** — free tier, sub-second inference, perfect for hackathon demos
- **Llama 3.3 70B** — best quality on Groq's free tier
- **Server-side only** — API key stays in `.env.local`, never sent to browser
- **Graceful degradation** — AI features are additive; core analysis works without API key
- **JSON extraction** — regex-based JSON parsing from LLM output for reliability
- **Copy to clipboard** — one-click copy on all AI-generated content

### New files
```
src/
├── app/api/ai/
│   ├── suggestions/route.ts     # AI resume suggestions endpoint
│   └── outreach/route.ts        # AI outreach message endpoint
├── components/analyzer/
│   ├── ai-suggestions.tsx       # Expandable AI suggestions panel
│   └── outreach-generator.tsx   # LinkedIn + Email message generator
```

### What is working
- Full analysis flow with local engine (no API key needed)
- AI suggestions button appears after analysis (requires GROQ_API_KEY)
- Outreach message generation (requires GROQ_API_KEY)
- Copy-to-clipboard on all AI content
- Error handling + retry for API failures
- Loading states for AI requests

### What is pending
- [x] Phase 6: Supabase integration (save sessions, optional auth)

### Setup required
To enable AI features, the user must:
1. Go to https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Create a free API key
3. Create `.env.local` in the project root with: `GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here`
4. Restart the dev server

---

## Phase 6: Supabase Integration (Auth + Sessions) ✅
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### What was built
- **Supabase client setup** — browser client (`@supabase/ssr`) + server client for API routes
- **Auth system** — email/password + GitHub OAuth sign-in/sign-up
- **AuthProvider** — React context wrapping the entire app, provides `user`, `loading`, `signOut`
- **AuthModal** — polished modal with email form + GitHub OAuth button, sign-in/sign-up toggle
- **UserMenu** — shows sign-in button when logged out, user email + history link + sign-out when logged in
- **Middleware** — refreshes Supabase auth sessions on every request
- **Session saving** — "Save" button appears after analysis (only when signed in), saves full results to Supabase
- **History page** (`/history`) — lists saved sessions with match score, risk level, keyword counts, date, delete
- **Delete session** — per-session delete with confirmation

### Database schema
- `analysis_sessions` table with RLS (Row Level Security)
- Users can only read/write/delete their own sessions
- Indexed on `user_id` and `created_at`

### API routes
- `POST /api/sessions` — save a new analysis session
- `GET /api/sessions` — get user's analysis history (latest 20)
- `DELETE /api/sessions/[id]` — delete a specific session
- `GET /auth/callback` — OAuth callback handler

### New files
```
src/
├── middleware.ts                      # Supabase auth session refresh
├── lib/supabase/
│   ├── client.ts                     # Browser Supabase client
│   └── server.ts                     # Server-side Supabase client
├── components/auth/
│   ├── auth-provider.tsx             # Auth context + useAuth hook
│   ├── auth-modal.tsx                # Sign-in/sign-up modal
│   └── user-menu.tsx                 # User controls in header
├── app/
│   ├── auth/callback/route.ts        # OAuth callback
│   ├── api/sessions/route.ts         # Save + list sessions
│   ├── api/sessions/[id]/route.ts    # Delete session
│   └── history/page.tsx              # Session history page
supabase/
└── schema.sql                        # Database schema (run in SQL Editor)
```

### Key decisions
- **@supabase/ssr** over `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` — official recommended approach for App Router
- **RLS policies** — security at the database level, not just API level
- **Save is optional** — analysis works without auth, save button only appears when signed in
- **Graceful degradation** — entire app works without Supabase if env vars are missing

### What is working
- Email/password authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- GitHub OAuth (if configured in Supabase dashboard)
- Save analysis sessions after running analysis
- View session history at /history
- Delete individual sessions
- Auth state persists across page reloads
- All pages responsive and mobile-friendly

### What is pending
- [x] File upload + AI resume rewriter
- [ ] Polish UI + final touches
- [ ] Vercel deployment

## Bugfix: White Screen on Next.js 16
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### Root cause
- `middleware.ts` is deprecated in Next.js 16 — was blocking client-side hydration
- Cross-origin HMR was blocked by default in Next.js 16

### Fixes applied
- Deleted `src/middleware.ts`
- Added `allowedDevOrigins` to `next.config.ts`
- Fixed `AuthProvider` with `useMemo` for stable Supabase client + error handling
- Temporarily removed `AuthProvider` from root layout (can re-add with error boundary later)

---

## Feature: File Upload + AI Resume Rewriter ✅
**Date:** 2026-03-21

### What was built
- **File Upload component** — drag-and-drop or browse for PDF, DOCX, TXT files (max 5MB)
- **Parse Resume API** (`/api/parse-resume`) — server-side file parsing using `pdf-parse` + `mammoth`
- **AI Resume Rewriter API** (`/api/ai/rewrite`) — generates 3 different rewrite versions via Groq Llama 3.3
- **Resume Rewriter UI** — tabbed selector with 3 versions, copy-to-clipboard, regenerate button

### Rewrite versions
1. **Keyword-Optimized** — maximizes keyword matches while keeping content authentic
2. **Achievement-Focused** — rewrites bullets to emphasize measurable impact and results
3. **Skills-Forward** — reorganizes to lead with a skills summary mirroring job requirements

### New dependencies
- `pdf-parse` — PDF text extraction
- `mammoth` — DOCX text extraction

### New files
```
src/
├── app/api/
│   ├── parse-resume/route.ts        # PDF/DOCX/TXT → text extraction
│   └── ai/rewrite/route.ts          # AI resume rewriter (3 versions)
├── components/analyzer/
│   ├── file-upload.tsx               # Drag-and-drop file upload
│   └── resume-rewriter.tsx           # 3-tab rewrite selector with copy
```

### User flow
1. Upload resume (PDF/DOCX/TXT) OR paste text
2. Paste job description
3. Click "Analyze Match" → see results
4. Click "Generate Rewritten Resumes" → get 3 AI-rewritten versions
5. Select preferred version → copy to clipboard

### What is pending
- [ ] Polish UI + final touches
- [ ] Vercel deployment
